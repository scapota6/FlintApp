# Engineering Activity Log

## Current Issues Identified (2025-07-26)

### Critical Fixes Needed:
1. **Activity Log Description Field**: Database constraint violation - description field is required but being passed as null
2. **Type Errors in Routes**: Multiple type mismatches for balance calculations and activity logging
3. **SnapTrade Authentication**: Still using wrong header 'consumerKey' instead of 'consumerSecret' in registration endpoint
4. **Missing Schema Fields**: Activity log expecting 'details' field but schema only has 'metadata'

### Missing Features From Documentation:
1. **Auth0 Integration**: Currently using Replit Auth instead of Auth0 as specified
2. **News Aggregation**: No news feed implementation
3. **Community Features**: No asset-specific community feeds
4. **Notification System**: Missing email/push notification system
5. **Admin Panel Enhancements**: Basic admin features missing
6. **WebSocket Integration**: No real-time updates implemented
7. **Mobile PWA Features**: Missing PWA configuration
8. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Not implemented
9. **Profile Management**: No user profile page

### Architecture Gaps:
1. **State Management**: Using basic React hooks instead of Zustand as specified
2. **Error Monitoring**: No Sentry integration
3. **Analytics**: No Mixpanel/LogRocket integration
4. **Testing**: No Jest/Testing Library setup
5. **Docker/CI-CD**: Missing deployment automation
