## Current Issues Identified (2025-07-26)

### Critical Fixes Needed:
1. **Activity Log Description Field**: Database constraint violation - description field is required but being passed as null
2. **Type Errors in Routes**: Multiple type mismatches for balance calculations and activity logging
3. **SnapTrade Authentication**: Still using wrong header 'consumerKey' instead of 'consumerSecret' in registration endpoint
4. **Missing Schema Fields**: Activity log expecting 'details' field but schema only has 'metadata'

7. **Mobile PWA Features**: Missing PWA configuration
8. **Two-Factor Authentication**: Not implemented

### Architecture Gaps:
1. **State Management**: Using basic React hooks instead of Zustand as specified
