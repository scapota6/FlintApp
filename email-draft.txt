Subject: SnapTrade Integration Issue - Signature Verification Failing

Hello SnapTrade Support Team,

We're experiencing signature verification issues with the SnapTrade TypeScript SDK despite following the official documentation exactly.

## Issue Details
- Client ID: FLINT-AGFQD  
- Error: 401 'Unable to verify signature sent' during user registration
- SDK Version: snaptrade-typescript-sdk@9.0.118
- API Status Check: Working (version 151, online: true)

## What's Working
✓ API status endpoint responds correctly
✓ SDK initialization successful
✓ Environment variables properly configured
✓ Code matches official GitHub documentation exactly

## What's Failing  
✗ User registration with 401 signature verification error
✗ All subsequent API calls that require authentication

## Code Implementation
Our implementation follows the exact pattern from your GitHub documentation:

```typescript
const snaptrade = new Snaptrade({
  consumerKey: process.env.SNAPTRADE_CONSUMER_KEY,
  clientId: process.env.SNAPTRADE_CLIENT_ID,
});

const registerResponse = await snaptrade.authentication.registerSnapTradeUser({
  userId: snapTradeUserId  
});
```

## Questions
1. Are there any environment-specific configurations needed for API keys?
2. Could there be domain restrictions causing signature verification failures?
3. Are there any known issues with the current TypeScript SDK version?
4. What diagnostic information would help troubleshoot this issue?

We'd appreciate any guidance on resolving this signature verification issue.

Thank you for your assistance!
