Title: feat(ui): polished dashboard grid, modals & micro-interactions

1. Global Navbar  
   • Add a fixed top bar (#121212) with links: Dashboard, Trading, Transfers, Watchlist, News, Activity, Admin, and user avatar dropdown.  
   • Underline the active link in accent purple #8e44ad; links glow softly on hover (text-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(142,68,173,0.6)).  
   • Collapse into a hamburger menu on mobile.

2. Connected Accounts Grid  
   • Remove “Sync” & “Test API” buttons—just “+ Connect Bank” (blue) and “+ Connect Brokerage” (purple).  
   • Render connected accounts as a responsive 3-column grid (cards 30% width, min-width 240px, 1% gutter).  
   • Card style: 16px border-radius, subtle purple glow border (box-shadow: 0 0 8px rgba(142,68,173,0.4)).  
   • On hover: lift & scale (transform: translateY(-4px) scale(1.03)), 200ms ease.

3. Account Details Modal  
   • Each card has a “Details” button opening an in-app modal (80% viewport, #1e1e1e background, white text).  
   • Modal tabs: Overview, Holdings, Transactions—active tab has animated purple underline.  
     - **Overview:** live balances, quick-stat cards.  
     - **Holdings:** table of positions (symbol, qty, avg price, live price, P/L) with inline sparklines.  
     - **Transactions:** timeline list with colored icons (green buys, red sells).  
   • Animate open (fadeIn + slideUp 300ms) and close (fadeOut).

4. Quick Actions Bar  
   • Full-width bar below accounts with three buttons: Quick Buy (green), Quick Sell (red), Transfer Funds (purple).  
   • On hover: button glows and icon pulses gently.

5. Real-time Prices & Charts  
   • Embed a simple TradingView line chart at real prices; default to dark theme: `theme: "dark"`.  
   • Sync the chart’s current price & metadata to match our backend values exactly.

6. Order Placement Fixes  
   • Generate a unique `tradeId` (e.g., UUID v4) and supply it to the `placeOrder` call.  
   • Ensure order forms capture symbol, quantity, order type; call SnapTrade trade endpoint; show toasts on success/error.

7. Skeleton & Error States  
   • While loading data: show pulsating skeleton cards.  
   • On fetch error: replace the card with a red-bordered box reading “Failed to load. Retry?” that retries on click.

8. UI/UX Consistency & Styling  
   • Use Inter font: headings white weight 600; body #CCCCCC weight 400.  
   • Standardize buttons: 48px height, 12px padding, 8px radius, accent glow on hover.  
   • Add tooltips on hover (“Buy quickly”, “View details”) with 200ms fade-in.  
   • All interactive elements keyboard-focusable with visible purple focus outlines.  
   • Responsive: on narrow screens, stack to full-width cards; modal full-screen on mobile.

9. Error & Data Guards  
   • In Activity and Transfers pages, ensure `activities` and `transfers` are arrays before `.filter`, e.g.:  
   ```ts
   const list = Array.isArray(activities) ? activities : [];
   const filtered = list.filter(...);
