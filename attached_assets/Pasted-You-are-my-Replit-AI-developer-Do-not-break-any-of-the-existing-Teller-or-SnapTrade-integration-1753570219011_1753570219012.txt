You are my Replit AI developer. Do **not** break any of the existing Teller or SnapTrade integrations.

Please implement the remaining MVP features in priority order, including:

1. **Order Entry & Live Charts**  
   - Embed/chart component on each instrument page.  
   - “Buy/Sell” form wired to a new `POST /api/order` endpoint.  
   - Use SnapTrade’s `placeOrder` (or broker sandbox API) for real trades.  
   - Show order confirmations and update user balances in real time.

2. **Position & Holdings Display**  
   - After trades fill, fetch `GET /api/snaptrade/holdings` and display positions with P/L on dashboard.  
   - Poll or use webhooks so balances update live.

3. **Watchlist CRUD**  
   - Add “Add to Watchlist” and “Remove” buttons.  
   - Persist in your database and expose `GET/POST/DELETE /api/watchlist`.  
   - Show the current watchlist on the dashboard.

4. **Price Alerts & Notifications**  
   - Create UI to set simple threshold alerts (e.g. price > X).  
   - Build backend scheduler or webhook stub to fire alerts.  
   - Send in-app notification banners and log to the activity feed.

5. **Activity Feed**  
   - Centralize all major events (login, connect, trade, transfer, alert) into a scrollable Activity page.

6. **In-App Transfers (Phase 1)**  
   - Simple “Transfer Funds” form between connected Teller bank accounts (`POST /api/transfer`).  
   - Validate amounts, show pending/completed status.

7. **UX & Performance Polish**  
   - Add skeleton loaders/spinners and friendly error messages everywhere.  
   - Lazy-load heavy charting code.  
   - Ensure dashboard and trade pages are fully responsive.

8. **Security & Validation**  
   - Add schema validation (Zod or Joi) on all new endpoints.  
   - Throttle high-risk routes.  
   - Ensure existing secrets remain encrypted at rest.

9. **Testing**  
   - Write unit tests for new services (order-placement, watchlist, transfers).  
   - Add Cypress/E2E tests covering: login → connect account → place trade → view position.

10. **Deployment Pipeline**  
    - Set up GitHub Actions (or Replit Deploy Hooks) to run lint, tests, and build on every PR.  
    - Create a staging environment mirroring production keys for safe testing.  

Work top-down through this checklist, confirm each major milestone with a Replit commit entry, and automatically rollback any change that breaks an existing Teller or SnapTrade integration. Once complete, push to `main` and notify me.
