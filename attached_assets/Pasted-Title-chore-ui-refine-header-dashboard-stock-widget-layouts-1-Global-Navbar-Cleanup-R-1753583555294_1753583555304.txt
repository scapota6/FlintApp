Title: chore(ui): refine header, dashboard & stock widget layouts

1. Global Navbar Cleanup  
   • Remove duplicate “Dashboard” in header—only one set of links.  
   • Keep FLINT logo on left, fixed top bar (#121212).  
   • Links: Dashboard, Trading, Transfers, Watchlist, News, Activity; user avatar dropdown on right.  
   • Underline active link in purple #8e44ad; hover glow (text-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(142,68,173,0.6)).  
   • Collapse into hamburger on mobile.

2. Dashboard Layout Adjustments  
   • Remove “Welcome back” from header; keep only on Dashboard page, using user’s first name.  
   • Total Balance / Bank Accounts / Investments cards: add tiny inline sparkline overlays.  
   • Ensure “Connect Bank/Credit Card” (blue) and “Connect Brokerage/Crypto Wallet” (purple) buttons sit above a responsive 3-column grid (cards 30% width, min-width 240px, 1% gutter).  
   • Cards: 16px radius, purple glow border (0 0 8px rgba(142,68,173,0.4)), hover lift & scale (translateY(-4px) scale(1.03), 200ms).  
   • Move Quick Buy/Sell/Transfer bar immediately below accounts grid; full-width buttons with icons.

3. Stock Widget & Watchlist Styling  
   • On Dashboard: remove individual AAPL widget; move stock details to /stock/[symbol] pages only.  
   • Show Watchlist entries with their real-time prices (from backend aggregate), not 0 mock values; add company logo icons.  
   • Enforce consistent card styling across Dashboard, Trading, Watchlist, Activity, Transfers, News pages—dark #121212 background, purple borders, Inter font.

4. Account Details Modal Fix  
   • Change “Details” button to open in-page modal, not navigate away.  
   • Modal: Overview / Holdings / Transactions tabs with purple underline animations, fadeIn/slideUp.

5. TradingView Chart Embedding  
   • Use simple line chart embed (dark theme, theme: “dark”) with correct symbol / exchange code.  
   • Ensure live price shown in chart header matches backend SnapTrade data (sync every 5s).

6. Responsive & Accessibility  
   • All pages: stack grid full-width on mobile; modals full-screen.  
   • Keyboard focus states on buttons (outline: 2px solid #8e44ad).  
   • Tooltips on hover for buttons (200ms fade-in).
