# Flint Security Guidelines Document

## Authentication & Authorization Rules

### OAuth Flows
- **OAuth 2.0**: Implement OAuth 2.0 for secure authorization with third-party services. Ensure the use of authorization codes and access tokens.
- **Persistent Sessions**: Use refresh tokens to maintain persistent sessions without requiring frequent re-authentication.
- **Revoke Access**: Provide users with the ability to revoke access to their accounts at any time.

### JWT Handling
- **Token Security**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure and stateless authentication.
- **Expiration**: Set appropriate expiration times for access tokens and implement mechanisms for token refresh.
- **Signature Verification**: Always verify the JWT signature using a secure algorithm like RS256.
- **Token Storage**: Store tokens in secure, HttpOnly cookies to prevent XSS attacks.

### RBAC Implementation
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to manage user permissions based on roles such as admin, user, and guest.
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Assign the minimum necessary permissions to each role to perform their functions.
- **Role Management**: Provide an admin interface for managing user roles and permissions.

## Data Validation Rules

### Input Sanitization
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Cleanse and sanitize all user inputs to prevent SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.
- **Whitelist Approach**: Use a whitelist approach to validate input against known good patterns.

### Type Checking
- **Strict Typing**: Implement strict type checking for all inputs in both client and server-side code using TypeScript.
- **Validation Libraries**: Utilize libraries like Joi or Yup for schema validation.

### Boundary Validation
- **Range Checks**: Ensure all numerical inputs are within acceptable and secure boundaries.
- **Length Checks**: Validate string lengths to prevent buffer overflow attacks.

## Environment Variables

### Secure Storage
- **Sensitive Data**: Keep all sensitive data such as API keys, database credentials, and encryption secrets in environment variables.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to environment variables to authorized personnel only.

### Encryption
- **Secure Encryption**: Use tools like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault to securely manage environment variables.

## Rate Limiting/Throttling

### Limits Per Endpoint
- **API Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limits on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
- **User-Specific Limits**: Apply user-specific rate limits to protect against account abuse.

### DDoS Protection
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Use traffic monitoring tools to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks.
- **Throttling**: Implement IP-based throttling to limit requests from potential attackers.

## Error Handling & Logging

### Secure Error Messages
- **Generic Messages**: Display generic error messages to end-users to avoid disclosing sensitive information.
- **Detailed Logs**: Log detailed error information on the server-side for debugging purposes.

### Logging Practices
- **Sensitive Data**: Do not log sensitive data such as passwords, tokens, or personal identifiers.
- **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation to manage log file sizes and retention.

## Security Headers/Configs

### CORS Settings
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Restrict CORS to trusted domains only to prevent unauthorized access.

### CSP Policies
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement CSP to mitigate XSS attacks by defining trusted sources for content.

### HTTPS Enforcement
- **SSL/TLS**: Enforce HTTPS for all data in transit to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Dependency Management

### Package Updates
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
- **Automated Tools**: Use tools like Dependabot or Renovate to automate dependency updates.

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Security Scans**: Conduct regular security scans on dependencies to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

## Data Protection

### Encryption at Rest and In Transit
- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt all sensitive data at rest using AES-256 or better.
- **Transport Layer Security**: Use TLS 1.2 or higher to encrypt data in transit.

### PII Handling
- **Minimal Data Collection**: Collect only the necessary Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to protect PII from unauthorized access.

By adhering to these security guidelines, Flint ensures a secure and reliable platform for all users, prioritizing the protection of user data and maintaining high standards of security compliance.
