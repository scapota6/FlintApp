Title: feat(ui): unify UI across all pages, real-time data & fix quick actions

1. Global Navbar & Header  
   • Ensure the fixed top bar (#121212) appears on every route (Dashboard, Trading, Transfers, Watchlist, News, Activity, Admin) with consistent styling.  
   • Active link underlined in #8e44ad, soft glow on hover (text-shadow: 0 0 6px rgba(142,68,173,0.6)).  
   • “Welcome back, {FirstName}” greeting on Dashboard and persists on all pages (extract first name from user.email).  
   • Collapse into hamburger menu on mobile.

2. Connected Accounts Section  
   • Replace elongated single card with responsive 3-column grid (cards 30% width, min 240px, 1% gutter).  
   • Card header: icon + “Alpaca Paper” with label “Brokerage/Crypto Wallet” or “Bank/Credit Card” as appropriate.  
   • Remove “Test API” and “Sync” buttons—only “+ Connect Bank/Credit Card” (blue) and “+ Connect Brokerage/Crypto” (purple).  
   • Card style: 16px border-radius, border glow (0 0 8px rgba(142,68,173,0.4)), lift & scale (transform: translateY(-4px) scale(1.03)) on hover.

3. Account Details Modal  
   • “Details” on each card opens in-app modal (80% viewport, #1e1e1e background) with tabs Overview/Holdings/Transactions.  
   • Overview: live balances, quick stats.  
   • Holdings: table with symbol, qty, avg price, live price, P/L.  
   • Transactions: timeline with green/red icons.  
   • Animate modal in/out (fadeIn + slideUp 300ms; fadeOut).

4. Quick Actions Bar  
   • Ensure buttons Quick Buy (green), Quick Sell (red), Transfer Funds (purple) trigger respective flows.  
   • Wire Buy/Sell to open trade form with pre-filled symbol/quantity; generate UUID v4 tradeId; call placeOrder and show toast.  
   • Transfer Funds opens money transfer route.  
   • On hover: glow and icon pulse.

5. Real-time Price Sync & Charts  
   • Swap in a simple dark-theme line chart (TradingView `theme: "dark"`) that pulls real-time prices from our backend or TradeView API.  
   • Ensure the chart’s current price matches the price shown in asset list exactly.

6. Stock Search & Listings  
   • Restore search bar on all pages (e.g. Trading), styled consistently.  
   • Asset list in Trading: show live price, % change refreshing every 15s.  
   • “Watch” toggles item in Watchlist; “Trade” opens trade form.

7. Watchlist & Holdings Layout  
   • Convert Watchlist/Holdings cards to match Dashboard styling (grid cards).  
   • Show counts badge (“3 items”, “2 positions”).  
   • On empty state, show centered CTA “Add Symbol” or “Connect Brokerage”.

8. Page-specific UI Consistency  
   • Use same background (#121212), card styles, fonts, button styles across Trading, Transfers, Watchlist, News, Activity.  
   • Fix Activity & Transfers runtime errors by guarding arrays:  
     ```ts
     const acts = Array.isArray(activities) ? activities : [];
     const filtered = acts.filter(a => ...);
     ```  
   • Ensure no console errors.

9. Routing & Auth Flow  
   • Confirm all pages protected behind auth; redirect to login/signup as needed.  
   • Navbar “Admin” only visible to admin users.

10. Styling & Micro-interactions  
   • Inter font: headings white 600; body #CCCCCC 400.  
   • Buttons: accent glow, smooth scale on hover, tooltips after 200ms.  
   • Keyboard-focusable with purple outline.  
   • Page-load sparkle effect on Dashboard title; smooth page transitions via Framer Motion.

Please implement in one PR “feat(ui): unify UI across pages & enable real-time data” and verify end-to-end that trading, account connections, chart sync, and quick actions function correctly without breaking existing flows.
